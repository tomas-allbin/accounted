 * What the ledger knows about one legal form. Contract: docs/LEGAL-FORMS.md.
 *
 * A form is data (one object below per form); a capability is the API (a
 * field on that object). Code asks what a company can do and never which
 * form it is, so the fourth form is one more profile, not another sweep of
 * `=== 'aktiebolag'` sites. Every field must have at least two forms that
 * answer it differently; a field every form answers the same way is a
 * constant and does not belong here.
 *
 * The fields describe what THIS PRODUCT does for the form, not what the law
 * says in general. `filings.incomeReturn` is null for a form whose return is
 * not modelled yet, even when the statute names one (ideell förening: INK3).
