 * The port was lossless when it landed, which is what makes phase 2b (swapping
 * the seeded rows for the loader) a no-op for existing companies.

 * Templates have since been fixed on purpose. Each deliberate change is listed
 * in INTENTIONAL_DIVERGENCES with its reason, and the list is policed from both
 * sides: a pack NOT listed must still match the seed exactly, and a pack that
 * IS listed must actually differ. So an unnoticed edit fails the build, and a
 * stale entry cannot linger after a template is reverted.
