 *
 * Why `includeUnassigned` exists: a NULL cash_account_id row belongs to exactly
 * ONE account, but the query can't tell which: these are unbooked rows in
 * companies with ≥2 same-currency accounts (the backfill refuses to guess
 * between checking + savings) and booked own-account transfers the backfill
 * deliberately skips (>1 bank-class line). Attributing them to EVERY
 * same-currency account double-counts them: a 1931 savings account would pull in
 * 1930's unassigned rows, so Bankavstämning reported a large bogus difference
 * for 1931 while 1930 itself still reconciled. The fix: only the company's
 * PRIMARY cash account (cash_accounts.is_primary, exactly one per company)
 * claims NULL rows; every other account scopes strictly to its own id. Callers
 * pass `includeUnassigned = <this account is_primary>`. When cashAccountId is
 * omitted (single-account companies with no row, the '1930' fallback) the pure
 * currency filter is used and includeUnassigned is moot.
 *
 * Account-scoped callers must resolve the row FIRST (see resolveCashAccountScope
 * in lib/reconciliation/cash-account-scope.ts). Omitting cashAccountId is the
 * legacy fallback for a company with no cash_accounts row at all; doing it on a
 * company that HAS several is issue #1290: the transaction side pools every
 * same-currency account while the GL side stays on one account, producing a
 * difference with nothing unmatched to point at.
 *
 * Not every remaining unscoped caller is intentional. The post-sync sweeps in
 * app/api/extensions/enable-banking/sync/cron/route.ts and
 * extensions/general/enable-banking/index.ts call runReconciliation without a
 * scope, which is a known open defect rather than a supported mode: they need
 * one run per cash account, not one pooled run. Tracked as issue #1298;
 * warnIfUnscopedAcrossCashAccounts below makes both visible in the logs until
 * that is fixed.
 *
 * The earlier nested `or(cash_account_id.eq.X,and(cash_account_id.is.null,currency.eq.cur))`
 * form is intentionally avoided: it silently returned ZERO rows mid-backfill.
 * A cash account has exactly one currency, so the flat two-term `or` is reliable.
