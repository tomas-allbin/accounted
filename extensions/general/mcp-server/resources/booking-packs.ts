/**
 * The konteringspaket catalogue, for agents.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Without it an agent proposing a booking has to invent the account numbers,
 * and a plausible-looking guess (6071 instead of 6072, or the full cost instead
 * of the 80% deductible share) produces a verifikat that posts but is wrong.
 * A named catalogue turns "here are some accounts I think apply" into "this is
 * the representation-avdragsgill-25-moms template", which the user can
 * recognise, and which carries the statutory note explaining when it applies.
 *
 * ## Read from packs, not from the database
 *
 * `legal_note` lives only in the YAML: `booking_template_library` has no column
 * for it, so the database copy cannot answer "when does this template apply".
 * That note is the most valuable field here, because it is the part an agent
 * cannot derive from account numbers.
 *
 * The catalogue is identical for every company (system templates are global),
 * so nothing here is company-scoped and no `companyId` filter applies. A
 * company's OWN templates are not included: those live in the database and are
 * reachable through the booking-template tools.
 *
 * Read on demand via resources/read, so this costs nothing in the tools/list
 * payload budget.
