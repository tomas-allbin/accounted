# Journal entries endpoints

The ledger itself: journal entries follow draft -> commit -> immutable. There is no edit or delete after commit; undo via reverse (storno) or correct. Voucher numbers are server-assigned and gapless; explain unavoidable gaps via voucher-gap-explanations.

Conventions (auth, envelope, pagination, dry-run, idempotency, standard errors)
are in SKILL.md and are not repeated per endpoint.

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries`

**List journal entries (verifikationer).**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Cursor-paginated list of journal entries ordered by created_at DESC, id ASC (newest-booked first; the `entry_date` column is the verifikationsdatum and is filterable via ?date_from / ?date_to but is not the sort key). Filters: fiscal_period_id, status, date_from, date_to. Excludes status=cancelled by default; pass status=cancelled to inspect storno-cancelled drafts.

**Use when:** You need to walk the verifikationsserie for a period (audit, SIE export, gap detection) or list recent activity for a UI.
**Do not use for:** Reading a single verifikation (use GET /{id}). Reading lines without the header (no separate endpoint: they ride in /{id}).

**Pitfalls:**
- Cancelled drafts are hidden by default. They are NOT a löpnummer gap (no voucher_number is allocated for drafts); the filter is for noise reduction.
- voucher_number=0 indicates a draft that has not been committed. Posted entries always have voucher_number > 0.
- Ordering is by created_at (when the verifikat was booked), not entry_date. A backdated verifikat appears where it was booked: filter on ?date_from / ?date_to when you need entry_date ranges, and walk the whole cursor chain when you need a full period.
- Cursor pagination: pass ?cursor=<next_cursor> from the previous response. A stale or tampered cursor is ignored and the first page is returned again.
- The date filters are named date_from / date_to. Unknown query parameters (?from, ?to, ?period_id, ...) are rejected with VALIDATION_ERROR listing unknown_params and allowed_params, not silently ignored: an ignored date filter returns every year and looks like a correct answer.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `fiscal_period_id` | query | `string` | no | Only entries in this fiscal period (id from GET /fiscal-periods). |
| `status` | query | `"draft" \| "posted" \| "cancelled"` | no | draft, posted or cancelled. Default: every status except cancelled. |
| `date_from` | query | `string` | no | YYYY-MM-DD. Entries whose entry_date (verifikationsdatum) is on or after this date. |
| `date_to` | query | `string` | no | YYYY-MM-DD. Entries whose entry_date is on or before this date. |
| `cursor` | query | `string` | no | Opaque cursor from the previous page's meta.next_cursor. Omit for the first page. |
| `limit` | query | `number` | no | Page size, 1-100 (default 50). Larger values are clamped to 100. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries`

**Create a draft journal entry (verifikation).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Creates a draft journal entry via the engine's createDraftEntry(). The draft has no voucher_number until /commit is called. Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key). Dry-runnable: a dry-run checks the body, the balance, the period lock and the lines' accounts against the chart without inserting any row, so it fails with ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART for the same accounts the live call would reject.

**Use when:** You're posting an arbitrary verifikation (manual journal entries, accrual reversals, period closing adjustments) outside the invoicing / supplier-invoice / transaction flows.
**Do not use for:** Bookkeeping flows that have a dedicated endpoint (invoices, supplier-invoices, transactions). Editing an existing posted entry: use /correct instead.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Lines must sum to zero (Σ debit = Σ credit). Engine rejects with JOURNAL_ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED on imbalance.
- entry_date must fall within fiscal_period_id's [period_start, period_end]; otherwise ENTRY_DATE_OUTSIDE_FISCAL_PERIOD.
- Every account_number must resolve in the company's chart of accounts: a standard BAS 2026 account that is not in the chart yet is added automatically, but a deactivated account, or a non-BAS number the chart does not contain, fails with ACCOUNTS_NOT_IN_CHART.
- voucher_series defaults to "A" if omitted. Must be a single uppercase letter.
- This creates a DRAFT only: call POST /{id}/commit to assign the voucher_number and post atomically, or DELETE /{id} to discard it. A draft left uncommitted blocks the year-end close (DRAFT_ENTRIES).

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/{id}`

**Retrieve a single verifikation by id.**
`scope:reports:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the full journal entry including all lines, dimensions, and the storno chain (reverses_id, reversed_by_id, correction_of_id).

**Use when:** You need the full verifikation for audit / reconciliation, or to display the line-by-line breakdown.
**Do not use for:** Listing entries (use the list endpoint with filters).

**Pitfalls:**
- Cancelled drafts are returned (no filter on status here); inspect status before assuming the entry is posted.
- Lines are sorted by sort_order; the order matters for display but not for accounting (the sum across lines is the meaningful quantity).

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |

### `DELETE /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/{id}`

**Cancel an uncommitted draft verifikation.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run`

Flips a draft journal entry to status=cancelled through the engine. A draft holds no voucher_number, so cancelling one leaves NO gap in the löpande nummerordning BFL 5 kap 7 § requires, and therefore needs no documented gap explanation. The header row survives as cancelled evidence rather than being deleted; its lines survive with it, and both stay archived for the 7 years BFL 7 kap requires. Posted and reversed entries are refused with 409 CANNOT_CANCEL_NON_DRAFT: a posted verifikation may only be undone through a rättelse that keeps the original visible and records who corrected it and when (BFL 5 kap 5 §), which is what /reverse (storno) does. Idempotent: cancelling an already-cancelled draft returns 200 with the same entry.

**Use when:** A draft created via POST /journal-entries will never be committed: a duplicate, an abandoned import, a draft the agent decided against. Stranded drafts block the year-end close (DRAFT_ENTRIES blocker), so clear them here instead of leaving them for a human in the app.
**Do not use for:** Undoing a posted verifikat (use POST /{id}/reverse for storno, or /{id}/correct to replace it). Editing a draft: there is no v1 draft-edit endpoint; cancel and create a new draft.

**Pitfalls:**
- Only status=draft can be cancelled. Anything posted returns 409 CANNOT_CANCEL_NON_DRAFT with details.currentStatus; storno it instead.
- No voucher number is released or burned: drafts never held one, so the unbroken series BFL 5 kap 7 § requires is untouched and there is no gap to document. The cancelled header stays visible via GET /{id} and via the list endpoint with status=cancelled.
- A draft in a locked or closed period, or behind the company lock date, returns PERIOD_LOCKED: unlock the period first rather than retrying.
- Idempotency-Key is optional here (unlike the other journal-entries writes) because the call is idempotent by construction: a second DELETE returns the same cancelled entry.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/{id}/commit`

**Commit a draft journal entry.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Atomically advances the voucher series and flips the draft to posted. The voucher_number is the smallest integer not yet used in (fiscal_period_id, voucher_series); a failed commit does NOT burn the number.

**Use when:** You created a draft via POST /journal-entries and now want to post it to the books. After commit the entry can only be changed through a rättelse that keeps the original visible and records who corrected it and when (BFL 5 kap 5 §): corrections require /reverse or /correct.
**Do not use for:** Re-committing an already-posted entry (returns 409). Committing across companies: the URL companyId must match the draft's company.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- Posted entries cannot be edited. Plan the lines carefully or call /correct after commit if you need to change them.
- Voucher numbers are sequential within (fiscal_period_id, voucher_series). A commit failure (e.g. period locked between draft creation and commit) does not advance the sequence.
- If the key has an unattended commit limit, an entry above it returns 403 UNATTENDED_COMMIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED and stays a draft for a human to commit. Do not split it into smaller entries: one affärshändelse is one verifikat (BFL 5 kap. 6 §).

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/{id}/correct`

**Correct a posted journal entry (BFL 5:5 storno-then-replace).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Per Bokföringslagen 5 kap 5 §, posted entries cannot be modified. This endpoint creates the canonical correction trail: a storno reversing the original, then a new entry with the corrected lines. All three are visible in the verifikationsserie and linked via reverses_id / reversed_by_id / correction_of_id. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** You need to amend a posted verifikation. Use this rather than /reverse when the entry is being REPLACED with new lines: /reverse just nullifies.
**Do not use for:** Drafts (no voucher_number: cancel via dashboard). Already-corrected entries (the chain only supports one correction; correct the latest in the chain).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- The new lines must balance. JOURNAL_ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED if not.
- The original's entry_date and fiscal_period_id are inherited. If the original's period has been locked since posting, the call returns PERIOD_LOCKED.
- Three voucher numbers are advanced in this call: the original (already burned), the reversal, and the corrected. The series stays unbroken.
- A chain 3+ corrections deep returns CORRECTION_CHAIN_TOO_DEEP (409). Compute the net effect of the whole chain and book ONE correction, or pass allow_deep_chain=true to override.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/{id}/reverse`

**Storno a posted journal entry.**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run`

Creates a reversing journal entry that nullifies the original. The original remains posted and visible: the reversal links via reverses_id and the original is annotated reversed_by_id. The reversal carries its own voucher_number in the same series so the löpnummer chain stays unbroken (BFL 5 kap 5-7 §§).

**Use when:** A posted entry needs to be cancelled and there is no replacement coming: e.g. a duplicate booking, an entry posted to the wrong period. Use /correct instead when you need to replace the entry with corrected lines.
**Do not use for:** Cancelling a draft (drafts have no voucher_number: use DELETE /journal-entries/{id}). Reversing an already-reversed entry (returns ENTRY_ALREADY_REVERSED).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- reversal_date defaults to today; the reversal is posted in the fiscal period covering that date. If today's period is locked the call returns PERIOD_LOCKED.
- You cannot reverse a draft (status must be posted). Use /correct after commit if the original needs replacing.
- Reversing an entry 3+ links deep in a correction chain returns CORRECTION_CHAIN_TOO_DEEP (409). Book ONE net-effect correction instead, or pass allow_deep_chain=true to override.

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/journal-entries/batch-create`

**Create up to 50 draft journal entries (partial-success).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:high · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Bulk-create endpoint mirroring /invoices/bulk-create and /suppliers/bulk-create. Each entry is validated and inserted independently: per-item failures do not roll back items that succeeded. Returns DRAFTS only; commit each separately. Idempotent over the whole batch. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** You're replaying historical bookkeeping from another system, or batching a set of manual verifikationer from a spreadsheet. Use dry-run first to validate the batch.
**Do not use for:** Committing posted entries: use POST /{id}/commit per entry. Transactional all-or-nothing imports: passing all_or_nothing: true returns 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory and covers the WHOLE batch.
- all_or_nothing: true returns 501 NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Today only partial-success batches exist.
- Each entry must balance independently. Per-item JOURNAL_ENTRY_NOT_BALANCED appears in the results array.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/voucher-gap-explanations`

**Document a gap in the verifikationsserie (BFL 5 kap 6-7 §§).**
`scope:bookkeeping:write · risk:low · idempotent · dry-run`

Records an explanation for one or more missing voucher numbers in a series. Required when a number is unaccounted for during audit. Statutory basis: BFL 5 kap 6-7 §§ (verifikationsnummer i löpande följd utan luckor); BFNAR 2013:2 kap 8 § governs the systemdokumentation that surfaces the gap. Idempotent. Dry-runnable.

**Use when:** You're responding to a voucher-gap audit finding and need to document the cause. Also used by migration flows that claim numbers without filling them.
**Do not use for:** Falsifying a series: every gap MUST have a genuine explanation. The dashboard surfaces these for auditor review.

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory.
- gap_end must be >= gap_start; a single-number gap has gap_start = gap_end.
- voucher_series is a single uppercase letter (A-Z); the same series + period + numeric range must not already exist.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

Request body:
```ts

  fiscal_period_id: string,
  voucher_series: string,
  gap_start: number,
  gap_end: number,
  explanation: string

{
  "fiscal_period_id": "a8f1…",
  "voucher_series": "A",
  "gap_start": 142,
  "gap_end": 145,
  "explanation": "Migration from previous bookkeeping system on 2026-05-12: series A148-onwards corresponds to the new Accounted numbering; numbers A142-A145 were assigned in the legacy system to manual paper vouchers archived offline (BFL 7 kap retention applies). Paper vouchers are stored in the company archive under reference 2026-PAPER-Q2."
