# Core endpoints

Connectivity, company discovery, async-operation polling, and company settings. Every session starts with GET /companies to resolve the companyId that all other URLs need.

Conventions (auth, envelope, pagination, dry-run, idempotency, standard errors)
are in SKILL.md and are not repeated per endpoint.

### `GET /api/v1/companies`

**List companies the API key can access.**
`scope:companies:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns every non-archived company the API key user is a member of, together with their role. Use the returned `id` as `{companyId}` in subsequent endpoints.

**Use when:** You need to discover which company IDs an API key has access to before calling company-scoped endpoints.
**Do not use for:** Fetching a single company you already know the id of: use GET /api/v1/companies/{companyId} for that.

**Pitfalls:**
- Multi-company keys (e.g. consultants) will see >1 result. Always pass the correct companyId in subsequent paths.
- Archived companies are excluded; if a company disappears the user has been removed from it or it was archived.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cursor` | query | `string` | no | Opaque cursor from the previous page's meta.next_cursor. Omit for the first page. |
| `limit` | query | `number` | no | Page size, 1-100 (default 50). Larger values are clamped to 100. |

### `POST /api/v1/companies`

**Create a company and set it up for bookkeeping.**
`scope:companies:write · risk:medium · dry-run`

Creates a new company owned by the API key user (or attached to one of their teams) and sets it up in one call: owner membership, BAS chart of accounts for the company form, compliance settings, the first fiscal period and the automatic tax deadlines. A 30-day trial with every paid capability starts immediately. Intended for partner platforms provisioning client companies (byrå/vertical SaaS) and for agents onboarding a user.

**Use when:** A platform or agent needs to provision a company that does not exist in Accounted yet. The caller becomes its owner; invite the end customer afterwards.
**Do not use for:** Companies that already exist (list them with GET /api/v1/companies), or changing settings on an existing company (PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/settings).

**Pitfalls:**
- A VAT-registered company MUST send moms_period (monthly / quarterly / yearly); the request is refused otherwise, because a missing period silently produces zero VAT deadlines.
- Bookkeeping duty under BFL starts when the company exists with a fiscal period: do not create companies to try things out. Use a test-mode key (dry run) for that.
- Enskild firma always runs on the calendar year; fiscal_year_start_month is ignored for it.
- first_fiscal_year is only for a company in its first year (BFL 3 kap.: up to 18 months). Omit it for an established company.
- Not idempotent, and Idempotency-Key is not honoured on this company-less route: a retry after a network failure creates a second company. List GET /api/v1/companies before retrying.
- org_number is required for a VAT-registered company (the invoice momsregistreringsnummer derives from it), and f_skatt must be stated explicitly: F-skatt approval is never assumed.
- accounting_method may be omitted: it then defaults by form (aktiebolag accrual, enskild firma and handelsbolag cash) and the response shows the resolved value. The cash default is only legal when turnover normally stays under 3 MSEK (BFL 4 kap 4 §): send accrual explicitly for a larger enskild firma.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `PATCH /api/v1/companies/{companyId}/settings`

**Partially update company settings.**
`scope:companies:write · risk:medium · idempotent · dry-run · reversible`

Patches the company payment details (bank account, Bankgiro, Plusgiro, Swish, IBAN/BIC), the contact details shown on invoices (contact_person, email, phone, website), and the custom invoice email texts. All fields optional; at least one must be supplied. Idempotent (mandatory Idempotency-Key). Dry-runnable. The same validation as the MCP staging tool applies: Bankgiro/Plusgiro numbers are Luhn-checked and invoice email texts only accept a fixed placeholder set.

**Use when:** You need to change the payment or contact details that appear on invoices, or override the invoice email texts, directly over REST instead of the staged MCP flow.
**Do not use for:** Legal or tax profile changes (org number, VAT registration, fiscal year, accounting method): those are not exposed on the public API. Reading settings (no GET endpoint yet; use the MCP tool gnubok_get_company_settings).

**Pitfalls:**
- Idempotency-Key is mandatory; calls without it return 400.
- contact_person is stored as default_our_reference: the default "Our reference" value on new invoices.
- bankgiro and plusgiro must carry a valid Luhn check digit; null or empty string clears them.
- invoice_email_texts only accepts the placeholders {fakturanummer} {kundnamn} {förnamn} {företag} {förfallodatum} {belopp}; any other {token} is rejected. Null clears every override.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `companyId` | path | `string` | yes |  |
| `dry_run` | query | `string` | no | true (any case) previews the write without committing it, like the X-Dry-Run: true header. Any other value commits. |

### `GET /api/v1/health`

**Health check.**
`risk:low · idempotent`

Reports the API is reachable and what version is currently served. Public; no auth required.

**Use when:** You want to verify connectivity, latency, or which API version is live before issuing other requests.
**Do not use for:** Anything that needs authenticated data. This endpoint returns no company-specific information.

**Pitfalls:**
- A 200 here only means the API process responds: downstream Postgres/Supabase may still be degraded.

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: { status: "ok" | "degraded", service: "gnubok", api_version: string, timestamp: string },
  meta: {
    request_id: string,
    api_version: string,
    next_cursor?: string | null,
    audit?: { voucher_number?: string, voucher_url?: string, audit_trail_url?: string, immutable_at?: string },
    partial_expansions?: string[],
    coverage?: Record<string, unknown>
  }
}
```

Example response `200`:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "service": "gnubok",
    "api_version": "2026-05-12",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-12T16:25:06Z"
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_…",
    "api_version": "2026-05-12"
  }
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/operations/{id}`

**Poll a long-running operation by id.**
`scope:operations:read · risk:low · idempotent`

Returns the current snapshot of a v1 async operation: status (queued / running / succeeded / failed / cancelled), progress (jsonb, free-form), result (on success), and error (on failure). The operation_id is returned by the POST endpoints that initiate async work (period close, year-end, currency revaluation, SIE import).

**Use when:** You started an async operation and need to know whether it has finished. Poll every 5-30 seconds until a terminal status. (The 202 response advertises `operation.completed` as the eventual push signal, but that webhook event is not deliverable yet — polling is the only supported completion signal today.)
**Do not use for:** Fetching the resource the operation produced: once status=succeeded, read the result field or call the resource-specific GET endpoint. Cancelling a running operation (no cancel endpoint exists in v1).

**Pitfalls:**
- Terminal statuses (`succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`) are final; the row never transitions out of them.
- progress is free-form jsonb; agents should treat it as opaque except for the documented fields `phase` (string), `current` / `total` (numbers for percent calculation).
- started_at is null while status=queued (the work has not begun yet); completed_at is null until a terminal status is reached.

| Parameter | In | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | path | `string` | yes |  |

Response `200`:
```ts
{
  data: {
    operation_id: string,
